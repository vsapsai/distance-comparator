2. Drag the map on the right => the map on the left should move too.

## Double click should put a comparison location marker.
1. Double click the map on the left => a marker should be put on the double click position, circle with a center at reference point and going through comparison point should be shown on the left map, circle of the same size should be shown at the right map.
2. Double click the map on the left within the circle => the comparison marker should move to a new position, circle should become smaller.
3. Double click the map on the right => the comparison marker should be shown on the right map, circles should update radii.
